### Category
Coding, general purpose

### Description
- This agent is based on a paper "AutoCodeRover: Autonomous Program Improvement".
- It combines LLMs with analysis and debugging capabilities to prioritize patch locations ultimately leading to a patch.
- Resolves ~16% of issues of SWE-bench (total 2294 GitHub issues) and ~22% issues of SWE-bench lite (total 300 GitHub issues).
- AutoCodeRover works in two stages:
  - Context retrieval: The LLM is provided with code search APIs to navigate the codebase and collect relevant context.
  - Patch generation: The LLM tries to write a patch, based on retrieved context.
- AutoCodeRover has two unique features:
  - Code search APIs are Program Structure Aware. Instead of searching over files by plain string matching, AutoCodeRover searches for relevant code context (methods/classes) in the abstract syntax tree.
  - When a test suite is available, AutoCodeRover can take advantage of test cases to achieve an even higher repair rate, by performing statistical fault localization.

### Category
Multi-agent, Coding, Build your own

### Description
MetaGPT is a multi-agent framework
MetaGPT has existed longer than other Devin alternatives, but after the release of Devin, the MetaGPT team aims to replace most of the Devin capabilities.
MetaGPT allows the assignment of different roles to GPTs to form a collaborative software entity for complex tasks.
You can use this multi-agent framework in your own scenario to build your own application.
Internally, MetaGPT includes agents with roles of product managers, architects, project managers, and engineers.
It provides the entire process of a software company along with carefully orchestrated SOPs. Code = SOP(Team) is the core philosophy.

## [SWE Agent](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent)
Open-source Devin alternative

<details>

![Image](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/raw/main/assets/swe-agent-banner.png)

### Category
Coding, general purpose

### Description
- This Devin alternative scores 12.3% on the FULL swe benchmark
- SWE-agent works by interacting with a specialized terminal, which allows it to:
	- 🔍 Open, scroll and search through files
	- ✍️ Edit specific lines w/ automatic syntax check
	- 🧪 Write and execute tests
- This custom-built interface is critical for good performance. Simply connecting an LM to a vanilla bash terminal does not work well.
- ["Our key insight is that LMs require carefully designed agent-computer interfaces (similar to how humans like  good UI design). E.g. When the LM messes up indentation, our editor prevents it and gives feedback."](https://x.com/jyangballin/status/1775114448513958134)
- SWE-agent was released by the Princeton NLP team.
- What makes SWE-agent special is that it performs almost as well as Devin on the SWE-bench.
- It is important to say that the performance [varies](https://www.swebench.com/) based on the model used by the agent.
- The changes and innovations in SWE-agent compared to Devin are:
  - The code in SWE Agent is executed locally via Docker.
  - It uses “Agent-Computer Interface” (ACI) - constraining the interface makes the agent easier to use for LMs. Only a few commants are allowed: run code, look for code, edit code and submit changes to GitHub.
- Any code the agent writes goes through a syntax check (linter) before being submitted. If the syntax is incorrect, the agent gets feedback and is forced to redo the code.
- The agent can only read 100 lines of code at a time, rather than the entire file. This makes it easier for the language model to understand the code.
